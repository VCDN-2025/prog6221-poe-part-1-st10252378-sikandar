# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot for South African Citizens

## Introduction

Cybersecurity has become a pressing concern in South Africa, with a dramatic rise in cyberattacks targeting individuals, businesses, and government institutions. These attacks often manifest through phishing scams, malicious software, and social engineering techniques, leaving citizens vulnerable to financial loss, identity theft, and emotional harm. In response to these growing threats, the South African Department of Cybersecurity has launched a public awareness campaign to help individuals identify and mitigate common online dangers.

As part of this initiative, this project introduces a **Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot**—a console-based application developed in C#. The chatbot is designed to simulate interactive conversations that teach users about various cybersecurity topics in a friendly, engaging, and practical way. The bot assists users in recognizing warning signs of cyber threats and suggests best practices to protect themselves in an increasingly digital world.

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to contribute to national cybersecurity awareness through technology, while demonstrating core programming principles. It allows users—especially those with limited technical backgrounds—to gain useful knowledge about staying safe online, all through a guided conversation. From a development perspective, it also serves as a foundation for building interactive console applications, emphasizing user input handling, multimedia integration, file management, and aesthetic console design.
